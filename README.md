This code will reproduce results from Federer & Zylberberg A self-organizing short-term dynamical memory network. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30007123 

To run the results in the supplemental section for networks with initially stronger synaptic strengths, set args['g'] = 1.6 (also works with various strengths but 1.6 was used in the paper results)
