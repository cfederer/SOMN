This code recreates the experiments from bioRxiv: 144683 (Federer & Zylberberg 2017). 
Some variability is to be expected due to random network initializations. 

Default arguments are set for each file to recreate the 100 iteration experiments
over seconds. Using --help on the command line will show options for changing
parameters, although some are set within the code. 

Please e mail Callie Federer (calliefederer@gmail.com) for any questions or if there 
are any bugs in the code. 

Results from our experiments for a fully connected, fully tuned random plastic network 
and a fully connected random constant network are saved in the stored folder so that
Figure 2 results do not have to be run before other experiments. Change the randomly generated
variable within the files to use your own results instead.
