This code recreates the experiments from bioRxiv: 144683 (Federer & Zylberberg 2017). 
Some variability is to be expected due to random network initializations. 

Default arguments are set for each file to plot my stored results. There are notes in the code 
for which lines to comment out and which to uncomment to run your own results. 

Please e mail Callie Federer (calliefederer@gmail.com) for any questions or if there 
are any bugs in the code.
