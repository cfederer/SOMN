This code will reproduce results from Federer & Zylberberg A self-organizing short-term dynamical memory network. https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/01/04/144683

To run the results in the supplemental section for networks with initially stronger synaptic strengths, set args['g'] = 1.6 (also works with various strengths but 1.6 was used in the paper results)
